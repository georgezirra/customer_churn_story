## 🚀 Project Overview
Customer churn is a major challenge for subscription businesses. In this project, I built and deployed a **churn prediction model** and translated its insights into a **data story** that’s accessible to non-technical audiences.  

The project includes:  
- 📈 **Exploratory Data Analysis** — identifying churn patterns.  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Model** — predicting churn with ~80% accuracy.  
- 🎨 **Interactive Web Story** — visuals + plain-English insights.  
- 📂 **Downloadable Notebook** — for those who want to dive into the code.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **8 out of 10 times** the model predicts correctly.  
- **At-risk customers** → new, on month-to-month contracts, and paying higher bills.  
- **Tenure & contracts** → the strongest drivers of churn.  
- **Proactive retention** → early onboarding, contract nudges, and billing transparency make a difference.
